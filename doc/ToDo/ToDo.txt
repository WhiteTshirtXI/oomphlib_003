\mainpage Completeness of the library and our To-Do list


The library is under active development. While most of its fundamental
objects have been stable (in the sense that their interfaces have not 
changed) for a long time, the current distribution contains
objects for certain advanced capabilities that are not completely
mature (yet!). You are most welcome to use these, provided you
understand that:
- Changes (improvements!) to these objects in subsequent revisions of
  the library  may force you to rewrite (parts of) your driver 
  codes when you upgrade.  
- The objects may not have been tested as rigorously as others.
.

 We tend to regard the process of writing tutorials that explain 
how to use a specific feature of the library as the final sanity check for its
implementation. The process of trying to explain how "easy" it is to 
use a certain feature in \c oomph-lib has often forced us to realise that 
our initial implementation was, in fact, not as easy to use
as we first thought. This realisation frequently suggested 
a re-implementation that sometimes involved significant 
changes to an object's interfaces. The development of a tutorial 
is usually accompanied by the development of systematic 
self-test procedures for the objects, making them more
bullet-proof, too. 

As a result we recommend adopting the following (overly pessimistic!) 
attitude towards the various objects in the library:
<CENTER>
<H2>
"If it's not documented it's (probably) inefficient or broken (or both)"
</H2>
</CENTER>
With this statement in mind, the
<A HREF="../../example_code_list/html/index.html">list of
tutorials/example codes</A>, should give you a good indication
of which features we currently regard as "mature". All tutorials 
labeled as "incomplete"  or "driver code only" demonstrate capabilities
that have not been given their final sanity check.

\section todo The To-Do list

<HR>


\subsection first Features/capabilities to be implemented and fully documented for the first "official" release:

- Finalise/document 2D/3D free-surface Navier-Stokes
- Finalise/document shell elements. 
- Eigenvalue problems and bifurcation tracking.
- Adaptive load balancing for distributed problems. 
.
\b Note: Most of this functionality is already available in the current 
distribution but no documentation has been written as yet.

<HR>  

 
\subsection not_first Features/capabilities currently under development but not scheduled for inclusion in the first official release:

- Geometric multigrid solvers: Extend Glyn's scalar version to 
  vector valued problems.
- Spectral elements.
- Discontinuous Galerkin methods
- Adaptivity for unstructured triangle/tet meshes.
- Adaptivity for \c SpineMeshes.
.
